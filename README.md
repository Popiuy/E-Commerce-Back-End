# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description
Built with starter code. This app shows how a company can easily change the database for their products with associated categories and tags. We used dotenv to to hide our user login to mysql.


## Usage
To use this app: have node.js, insomnia, mysql, sequelize, express, and dotenv. Run the schema.sql first, then run a npm install, and run npm start. This will start the app and then you can run insomnia to check the get post put and delete requests to my ecommerce_db.
